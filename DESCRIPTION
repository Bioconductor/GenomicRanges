Package: GenomicRanges
Title: Representation and manipulation of genomic intervals
Description: The ability to efficiently store genomic annotations and
	alignments is playing a central role when it comes to analyze
	high-throughput sequencing data (a.k.a. NGS data). The package
	defines general purpose containers for storing genomic intervals
	as well as more specialized containers for storing alignments
	against a reference genome.
