\title{Finding overlapping genomic ranges}

\description{
  Finds interval overlaps between a \link{GRanges}, \link{GIntervalTree}, \link{GRangesList}, \link{GAlignments}, \link{GAlignmentPairs}, 
  or \link{GAlignmentsList} object, and another object containing ranges.
}

\usage{
\S4method{findOverlaps}{GenomicRanges,GenomicRanges}(query, subject,
    maxgap = 0L, minoverlap = 1L,
    type = c("any", "start", "end", "within", "equal"),
    select = c("all", "first", "last", "arbitrary"),
    ignore.strand = FALSE)
\S4method{countOverlaps}{GenomicRanges,GenomicRanges}(query, subject,

    maxgap = 0L, minoverlap = 1L,
    type = c("any", "start", "end", "within", "equal"),
    ignore.strand = FALSE)
}

\arguments{
  \item{query, subject}{
    A \link{GRanges}, \link{GRangesList}, \link{GAlignments},
    \link{GAlignmentPairs}, or \link{GAlignmentsList} object. 
    \link[IRanges]{RangesList} and \link[IRanges]{RangedData} are 
    also accepted for one of \code{query} or \code{subject}. When
    \code{query} is a \link{GRanges} or \link{GRangesList} then 
    \code{subject} can be a \link{GIntervalTree} object.
  }
  \item{maxgap, minoverlap, type, select}{
    See \code{\link[IRanges]{findOverlaps}} in the IRanges package for
    a description of these arguments.
  }
  \item{ignore.strand}{
    When set to \code{TRUE}, the strand information is ignored in the
    overlap calculations.
  }
}

\details{
  When the query and the subject are \link{GRanges} or
  \link{GRangesList} objects, \code{findOverlaps} uses the triplet
  (sequence name, range, strand) to determine which features (see
  paragraph below for the definition of feature) from the \code{query}
  overlap which features in the \code{subject}, where a strand value
  of \code{"*"} is treated as occurring on both the \code{"+"} and
  \code{"-"} strand.
  An overlap is recorded when a feature in the \code{query} and a feature
  in the \code{subject} have the same sequence name, have a compatible
  pairing of strands (e.g. \code{"+"}/\code{"+"}, \code{"-"}/\code{"-"},
  \code{"*"}/\code{"+"}, \code{"*"}/\code{"-"}, etc.), and satisfy the
  interval overlap requirements. Strand is taken as \code{"*"}
  for \code{RangedData} and \code{RangesList}.

  In the context of \code{findOverlaps}, a feature is a collection of
  ranges that are treated as a single entity. For \link{GRanges} objects,
  a feature is a single range; while for \link{GRangesList} objects,
  a feature is a list element containing a set of ranges. In the results,
  the features are referred to by number, which run from 1 to
  \code{length(query)}/\code{length(subject)}.

  When the query or the subject (or both) is a \link{GAlignments}
  object, it is first turned into a \link{GRangesList} object (with
  \code{as( , "GRangesList")}) and then the rules described previously
  apply. \link{GAlignmentsList} objects are coerced to \link{GAlignments}
  then to a \link{GRangesList}. Feature indices are mapped back to the 
  original \link{GAlignmentsList} list elements.

  When the query is a \link{GAlignmentPairs} object, it is first
  turned into a \link{GRangesList} object (with \code{as( , "GRangesList")})
  and then the rules described previously apply.

  When the query is a \link{GRanges} or \link{GRangesList} object then
  the \link{subject} can be a \link{GIntervalTree} object. For repeated queries against the same subject, it is more efficient to create a \code{GIntervalTree} once for the subject using the \link{GIntervalTree} constructor described below and then perform the queries against
  the \code{GIntervalTree} instance. Note that \link{GIntervalTree}
  objects are not supported for circular genomes.
}

\value{
  For \code{findOverlaps} either a \link[IRanges]{Hits} object when
  \code{select = "all"} or an integer vector otherwise. 

  For \code{countOverlaps} an integer vector containing the tabulated
  query overlap hits.

  For \code{overlapsAny} a logical vector of length equal to the number of
  ranges in \code{query} indicating those that overlap any of the ranges
  in \code{subject}.

  For \code{subsetByOverlaps} an object of the same class as \code{query}
  containing the subset that overlapped at least one entity in \code{subject}.

  For \code{RangedData} and \code{RangesList}, with the exception of
  \code{subsetByOverlaps}, the results align to the unlisted
  form of the object. This turns out to be fairly convenient for
  \code{RangedData} (not so much for \code{RangesList}, but something
  has to give).
