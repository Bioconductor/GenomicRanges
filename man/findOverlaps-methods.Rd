\title{Finding overlapping genomic ranges}

\description{
  Various methods for finding/counting overlaps between objects containing
  genomic ranges. This man page describes the methods that operate on
  \link{GenomicRanges} and \link{GRangesList} objects.

  NOTE: The \code{\link[IRanges]{findOverlaps}} generic function
  and methods for \link[IRanges]{IntegerRanges} and
  \link[IRanges]{IntegerRangesList} objects are defined and
  documented in the \pkg{IRanges} package.
  The methods for \link[GenomicAlignments]{GAlignments},
  \link[GenomicAlignments]{GAlignmentPairs}, and
  \link[GenomicAlignments]{GAlignmentsList} objects are defined and
  documented in the \pkg{GenomicAlignments} package.

  \link{GenomicRanges} and \link{GRangesList} objects also support
  \code{countOverlaps}, \code{overlapsAny}, and \code{subsetByOverlaps} 
  thanks to the default methods defined in the \pkg{IRanges} package and
  to the \code{findOverlaps} and \code{countOverlaps} methods defined in
  this package and documented below.
}

\usage{
\S4method{findOverlaps}{GenomicRanges,GenomicRanges}(query, subject,
    maxgap=-1L, minoverlap=0L,
    type=c("any", "start", "end", "within", "equal"),
    select=c("all", "first", "last", "arbitrary"),
    ignore.strand=FALSE)

\S4method{countOverlaps}{GenomicRanges,GenomicRanges}(query, subject,
    maxgap=-1L, minoverlap=0L,
    type=c("any", "start", "end", "within", "equal"),
    ignore.strand=FALSE)
}

\arguments{
  \item{query, subject}{
    A \link{GRanges} or \link{GRangesList} object.
  }
  \item{maxgap, minoverlap, type}{
    See \code{?\link[IRanges]{findOverlaps}} in the \pkg{IRanges} package
    for a description of these arguments.
  }
  \item{select}{
    When \code{select} is \code{"all"} (the default), the results are
    returned as a \link{Hits} object.
    Otherwise the returned value is an integer vector parallel to \code{query}
    (i.e. same length) containing the first, last, or arbitrary overlapping
    interval in \code{subject}, with \code{NA} indicating intervals that did
    not overlap any intervals in \code{subject}.
  }
  \item{ignore.strand}{
    When set to \code{TRUE}, the strand information is ignored in the
    overlap calculations.
  }
}

\details{
  When the query and the subject are \link{GRanges} or
  \link{GRangesList} objects, \code{findOverlaps} uses the triplet
  (sequence name, range, strand) to determine which features (see
  paragraph below for the definition of feature) from the \code{query}
  overlap which features in the \code{subject}, where a strand value
  of \code{"*"} is treated as occurring on both the \code{"+"} and
  \code{"-"} strand.
  An overlap is recorded when a feature in the \code{query} and a feature
  in the \code{subject} have the same sequence name, have a compatible
  pairing of strands (e.g. \code{"+"}/\code{"+"}, \code{"-"}/\code{"-"},
  \code{"*"}/\code{"+"}, \code{"*"}/\code{"-"}, etc.), and satisfy the
  interval overlap requirements.

  In the context of \code{findOverlaps}, a feature is a collection of
  ranges that are treated as a single entity. For \link{GRanges} objects,
  a feature is a single range; while for \link{GRangesList} objects,
  a feature is a list element containing a set of ranges. In the results,
  the features are referred to by number, which run from 1 to
  \code{length(query)}/\code{length(subject)}.

  For \code{type="equal"} with GRangesList objects, \code{query[[i]]}
  matches \code{subject[[j]]} iff for each range in \code{query[[i]]}
  there is an identical range in \code{subject[[j]]}, and vice versa.
}

\value{
  For \code{findOverlaps} either a \link[S4Vectors]{Hits} object when
  \code{select="all"} or an integer vector otherwise. 

  For \code{countOverlaps} an integer vector containing the tabulated
  query overlap hits.
